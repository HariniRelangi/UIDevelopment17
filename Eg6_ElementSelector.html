   <p>This attribute declares the page's character encoding. It must contain a standard IANA MIME name for character encodings. Although the standard doesn't request a specific encoding, it suggests:

    Authors are encouraged to use UTF-8.</p>
    <p>Authors should not use ASCII-incompatible encodings to avoid security risk: browsers not supporting them may interpret harmful content as HTML.</p>
    
    <p>Authors must not use CESU-8, UTF-7, BOCU-1 and/or SCSU as cross-site scripting attacks with these encodings have been demonstrated.
    Authors should not use UTF-32 because not all HTML5 encoding algorithms can distinguish it from UTF-16.</p>
