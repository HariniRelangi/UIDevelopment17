        <p>An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.  A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position.
        It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).
        Note: Internet Explorer, Edge 15 and earlier versions do not support sticky positioning. Safari requires a -webkit- prefix (see example below).
        You must also specify at least one of top, right, bottom or left for sticky positioning to work. </p>
